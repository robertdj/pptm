\title{Get historical versions of packages}
\usage{
get_version(package_name, date, r_version = NULL, package_dir = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{package_name}{Name(s) of the package to install.}

\item{date}{Get \code{package_name} and its dependencies as they appeared on CRAN on \code{date}.}

\item{r_version}{An alternative to \code{date} is to choose the R version that \code{package_name} should match.
This will be the last date where \code{r_version} was the current R.
This ensures that all packages have been checked to work with this R version.}

\item{package_dir}{Directory where \code{package_name} and its dependencies are downloaded to. Note that it will contain a self-contained subset of CRAN.}
}

A dataframe with columns \code{Package}, \code{Version}, \code{Parent}, \code{URL}, \code{Filename}.
